Thank you for your interest in contributing to our project! We value your contributions and want to ensure a smooth and collaborative experience for everyone. Please take a moment to review the following guidelines.

## Linting

We use [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for code formatting and linting. After installing it via pip, you can automatically lint your code with black by adding it as a pre-commit git hook:
```bash
pip install black
echo -e '#!/bin/sh\n#\n# Run linter before commit\nblack $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)' > .git/hooks/pre-commit && chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

## Testing

[_Quis probabit ipsa probationem?_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quis_custodiet_ipsos_custodes%3F)

We have a comprehensive test suite that ensures the quality and reliability of our codebase. To run the python tests, you can use the following command:

```bash
pytest tests
```

Our CI excludes [tests/verify_questions.py](tests/verify_questions.py) as it depends on having a local postgres environment with the data loaded.

Please make sure that all tests pass before submitting your changes.

We also understand that some changes might not be easily testable with unit tests. In such cases, please provide a detailed description of your changes and how you tested them. We will review your changes and work with you to ensure that they are tested and verified.
